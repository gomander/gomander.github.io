          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a 22 year-old Swedish American with a passion for computers,
            coding, and games. I was born and raised in Silicon Valley, but
            moved back to Sweden to finish my education, and have lived here
            since.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my development journey with Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms in
            elementary school, then learned Java in middle and high school.
            From there, I moved on to Python, and eventually to
            JavaScript when I started working in web development. Lately I've
            been dipping my toes into Rust as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from the 2-year frontend development program at
            Medieinstitutet in Malmö in 2024. A large part of the program
            focused on React, but it also included units on API development,
            databases, and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Svelte + SvelteKit and Vue.js are my JS frameworks of choice, with
            which I've amassed a few years of experience. I also have years of
            experience in Node.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS/Sass/SCSS, and even
            Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing videogames with friends, and it's
            my dream to someday develop my own game and bring my ideas to life.
            I also really like to build computers and tinker with their parts.
